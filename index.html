                >1. Cipher Encryption Game Using Multiple Algorithms</span
            >
            <p class="section-two-span">
                This project is a cipher-based encryption game that allows users
                to encrypt messages using a variety of encryption algorithms,
                including Caesar, Substitution, Playfair, Transposition,
                Product, and RSA ciphers. I developed a graphical user interface
                (GUI) using Tkinter to enable users to interact with the game by
                selecting ciphers from a dropdown menu and entering messages to
                be encrypted. The program efficiently handles different
                encryption methods and displays both the original and encrypted
                messages in real-time, leveraging object-oriented programming
                principles to ensure modularity and ease of extension.

                >2. Implementation of a Queue Class in Python</span
            >
            <p class="section-two-span">
                In this project, I created a Queue class that implements
                fundamental queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and
                checking if the queue is empty. I used a list to manage the
                data, enabling elements to be added to the back and removed from
                the front, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. My
                implementation includes methods for retrieving the front
                element, checking if the queue is empty, and providing a string
                representation of the queue's current state. I also included
                test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the queue by
                enqueuing and dequeuing various integers while displaying the
                queue's state at each step.

            >
            <p class="section-two-span">
                In this project, I developed a simple program that calculates
                the total costs of items purchased. I defined the cost per item
                and the quantity, and then calculated the subtotal, tax, and
                total cost. The tax rate is set at 13%, and the program computes
                these values step by step. I also included formatted print
                statements to display the cost per item, quantity, subtotal,
                tax, and total cost with two decimal places for better
                readability. This program effectively demonstrates basic
                arithmetic operations and formatting in Python.
